This week was not to challenging other than the order of instructions in the lab as well as an issues with DNS needing to
be set to 10.0.5.5 for the wks instead of 10.0.5.2.
Ran into an error code in server manager, kerberos authentication error, looking into it but it has since disapeared.
learned how to pull up PRT and A records as well using GET and will be looking into this more.
